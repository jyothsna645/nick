author Nick Vujici (pronounced “Vooycheech”) was born in 1982 in
Melbourne, Australia. Without any medical explanation or warning
Nick came into the world with neither arms nor legs. Throughout his
childhood, Nick dealt not only with the typical challenges of school
and adolescence, such as bullying and self-esteem issues, he also
struggled with depression and loneliness as he questioned why he was
different from all the other kids. He couldn't get the haunting question
of “Why was I the one born without arms and legs?” out of his head.
As Nick grew up, he learned to deal with his disability and started to accomplish more and more on
his own. A janitor at his high school inspired him to start speaking publicly about overcoming
adversity, so Nick starting speaking to small groups of students when he was 17.</p>
